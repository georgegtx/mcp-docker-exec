# Summary of Fixes Applied

## 1. Docker Build Issues
- **Fixed**: Removed version pinning for Alpine packages (python3, make, g++, tini) that were no longer available in Alpine v3.22 repositories
- **Files changed**: `Dockerfile`

## 2. TypeScript/Linting Issues Fixed

### Type Safety Improvements
- **Fixed**: Replaced `any` types with proper error handling using type guards
- **Fixed**: Added proper error type checking with `error instanceof Error`
- **Files changed**: `src/docker/DockerManager.ts`

### Code Quality
- **Fixed**: Added `void` operator to floating promise in `setInterval`
- **Fixed**: Added block scopes to switch cases to avoid lexical declaration issues
- **Fixed**: Changed `async` method to regular method when no `await` is used (streamLogs)
- **Fixed**: Changed `let` to `const` for variables that are never reassigned
- **Fixed**: Prefixed unused parameter with underscore (`_containerId`)
- **Fixed**: Removed unnecessary escape in regex pattern
- **Fixed**: Removed unused import `ContainerLogsOptions`
- **Files changed**: 
  - `src/docker/DockerManager.ts`
  - `src/security/SecurityManager.ts`
  - `src/security/ShellCommandParser.ts`

### Race Condition Fix
- **Fixed**: Implemented proper race condition handling in `withTimeout` using a pending flag
- **Files changed**: `src/utils/withTimeout.ts`

## 3. Test Results
- All 32 unit tests are now passing ✅
- Integration tests fail due to Docker not being available (expected) ❌

## 4. Remaining Work
While the critical issues have been fixed, there are still some TypeScript linting warnings related to:
- Additional `any` type usage that could be improved
- Some unsafe member access patterns

These don't affect functionality but could be improved for better type safety.

## 5. Key Improvements Made
1. **Better Error Handling**: Proper type guards for error objects
2. **Memory Safety**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and resources
3. **Type Safety**: Reduced unsafe `any` usage where critical
4. **Code Quality**: Fixed all blocking linting errors
