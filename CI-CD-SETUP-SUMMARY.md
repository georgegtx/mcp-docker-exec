# CI/CD Setup Summary

A complete end-to-end automated build, packaging, and distribution solution has been set up for the `mcp-docker-exec` package. Here's what was implemented:

## üöÄ Key Components

### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**

#### Main CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)
- **Automated Testing**: Runs on every push and PR
  - Linting (ESLint + Prettier)
  - Unit tests (multiple Node.js versions)
  - Integration tests (with Docker)
  - Security scanning (npm audit, Snyk, CodeQL)
- **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation
- **Docker Publishing**: Builds and pushes to GitHub Container Registry
- **npm Publishing**: Automatically publishes on release
- **Multi-architecture support**: Docker images for different platforms

#### Release Management (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automatic version bumping based on commit messages
- **Changelog Generation**: Uses git-cliff for professional changelogs
- **GitHub Releases**: Creates releases with assets
- **Triggered by**:
  - Manual workflow dispatch
  - Commits to main (auto-detects version)

#### Pre-release Workflow (`.github/workflows/prerelease.yml`)
- Builds and publishes pre-release versions from feature branches
- Tagged as `next` on npm
- Useful for testing before official releases

### 2. **Dependency Management**

- **Dependabot Configuration**: Weekly updates for npm, Docker, and GitHub Actions
- **Auto-merge**: Patch updates merged automatically
- **Security alerts**: Integrated with GitHub Security

### 3. **Package Distribution**

#### npm Registry
- Package published as `mcp-docker-exec`
- Automated publishing on release
- Pre-releases available with `next` tag

#### Docker Registry (GitHub Container Registry)
- Images available at `ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-docker-exec`
- Multiple tags: `latest`, version tags, branch names
- Multi-architecture builds

### 4. **Quality Controls**

- **Branch Protection**: Configured for main and develop branches
- **Required Checks**: Tests must pass before merge
- **Code Reviews**: Required for main branch
- **CODEOWNERS**: Automatic review assignments

### 5. **Documentation**

- **CI/CD Guide**: Complete documentation in `docs/CI-CD-GUIDE.md`
- **Setup Script**: `scripts/setup-cicd.sh` for easy configuration
- **Updated README**: Installation options and badges

## üìã Setup Instructions

1. **Replace Placeholders**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-cicd.sh
   ```
   This will update all `YOUR_USERNAME` placeholders with your GitHub username.

2. **Add Secrets to GitHub**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Add `NPM_TOKEN` (required for npm publishing)
   - Add `SNYK_TOKEN` (optional for security scanning)

3. **Initial Commit**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: configure CI/CD pipeline"
   git push
   ```

4. **Create Development Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b develop
   git push -u origin develop
   ```

## üîÑ Release Process

### Automatic Releases
1. Use conventional commits:
   - `feat:` ‚Üí minor version
   - `fix:` ‚Üí patch version
   - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` ‚Üí major version

2. Push to main branch ‚Üí automatic release

### Manual Releases
```bash
gh workflow run release.yml -f release_type=minor
```

## üì¶ Distribution Channels

1. **npm Package**
   ```bash
   npm install mcp-docker-exec
   ```

2. **Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-docker-exec:latest
   ```

3. **GitHub Releases**
   - Source code archives
   - Compiled JavaScript bundles
   - Release notes with changelog

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- Automated dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Code quality analysis
- Branch protection rules
- Signed commits support

## üìä Monitoring

- GitHub Actions dashboard for build status
- npm download statistics
- Docker pull counts
- Codecov for test coverage

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Fully Automated**: Zero manual intervention required
2. **Professional**: Industry-standard CI/CD practices
3. **Secure**: Multiple security layers and checks
4. **Fast**: Parallel jobs and caching
5. **Reliable**: Comprehensive testing before release
6. **Transparent**: Clear versioning and changelogs

Your package is now ready for professional development and distribution! üéâ
